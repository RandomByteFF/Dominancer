Optimizes your code to assert dominance on the seniors

## Functions
It takes any code, deletes the linebreakers, and returns a one-liner code. The code has Copy and Paste functions, but Paste rarely works.

## TODO
  * The Paste button needs a fix

## Setup
If you just want to try it then I'm running it <a href="http://notmyevilbotnet.ddns.net/dominancer">here</a>. 
### Setup for yourself
I'm using Apache2 to run it. Just clone it into the `/var/www/html/` directory, and then run `sudo systemctl start apache2.service`. To stop the service, use `sudo systemctl stop apache2.service`.

## Inspiration
<a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/the-differences-between-a-junior-mid-level-and-senior-developer-bb2cb2eb000d">Daan</a> wrote a great article about what seperates a junior developer from a senior one. And two sentences caught my attention. "Quirky one-liners" and "This is the junior developer's way of showing off and letting the other developers know how good they can code". So that's how this horrible idea was born. This whole project is just a meme, please, don't take it seriously.
